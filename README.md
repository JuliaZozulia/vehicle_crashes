## Problem: Investigating factors leading to car crashes. 

Almost all of us drive every day. And we all face the danger of a car accident. Every day make a decision - should I drive to the destination via a highway or using local roads? Should I drive my child to school and let the school bus pick him/her up? Should I buy sedan, SUV or coupe?  Those decisions not only impact our convenience, but also our safety.
The goal of this project is to investigate the factors which led to a car accident, including those, impacting the severity of injuries during the impact, as well as create a model to predict car crashes.
The dataset contains details about police-reported car accidents that happened  in the US, including information about the vehicle, GRP coordinates,  road conditions, weather, information about the car, driver, severity of injury received by passengers.
The data was released by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration from the recently modernized Crash Report Sampling System. In 2017 the CRSS sample comprised 55,274 police crash reports, out of which 54,969 were eligible to be included in the final analytic file for weighting and estimation. These police crash reports were collected from 393 police jurisdictions in 60 responding sites across the country. In 2016 NHTSA collected data from 53 sites.  
The project could be used by insurance agencies, car dealers, or just by people who are looking for a new car (is an SUV really safer than a sedan?).


From the first plot, which can be found in the Jupiter Notebook, we can clearly see that modern cars provide much better protection for its riders, especially against severe and fatal insures. So the question of whether to upgrade the car is not only about convenience but also about safety.

The second plot shows the normalized distribution of injury severity per body type for accidents happened in 2016-2017 years. 
Different vehicle body types strongly impact the severity of the injury if a crash happened. 
For motorcycles, if crash happened, there is almost no chance not to receive any injury, while for any car your chances are about 45-70%.
